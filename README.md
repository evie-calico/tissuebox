# Tissue

Tissue is a simple note-taking application intended for programming.
Tissues are small, short term tasks that you can summarize in a single git commit.

Tissues are primarily meant to track and separate short-term tasks which can be tossed upon completion;
so long as each tissue is closed by a commit, git will keep a history of ocmpleted tasks on its own.
However, sometimes "small" issues turn out to be larger than initially expected,
and require long term archival such as a github issue to track progress over time.
In this case, tissues are designed to be trivial to promote into proper issues,
using the same basic fields (title, description, tags).
